  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy is provided by Greenwork Consulting, LLC, the owner and operator of the fairydust app and website. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to transparency in how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you sign in via a third-party provider (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook), we receive basic profile details like your name, email address, and profile photo.</p>

  <h3>1.2 Usage Information</h3>
  <p>We collect data about your interactions with the Service, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apps you use</li>
    <li>DUST token activity and transactions</li>
    <li>Time spent in features</li>
    <li>Referral and reward participation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Device and Technical Information</h3>
  <p>We may collect technical data like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Device type and OS</li>
    <li>Browser and language settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.4 User-Generated Content</h3>
  <p>If you provide a username, icon, or content such as story prompts or community comments (outside of Kid Mode), we store and may display that within the Service.</p>

  <h3>1.5 Optional Child Profile Information</h3>
  <p>Adults using the app may optionally enter a child's first name, birthday, and upload a photo in order to personalize the Kid Mode experience. This information is stored securely and used only locally within your account. We do not collect additional data from children directly.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate and improve the Service</li>
    <li>Provide access to apps and features</li>
    <li>Maintain your DUST balance and track usage</li>
    <li>Send important account-related messages</li>
    <li>Analyze and enhance product functionality</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vendors:</strong> For infrastructure, analytics, or customer support tools we use</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> If required to do so by law or in the interest of protecting safety or rights</li>
    <li><strong>Business changes:</strong> If Greenwork Consulting, LLC is involved in a merger or acquisition, your data may be transferred accordingly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use cookies and similar technologies to operate the Service and understand usage. Analytics tools help us improve the experience but are not active in Kid Mode.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect your information. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Update or delete your account at any time</li>
    <li>Control cookie settings in your browser</li>
    <li>Request removal of any optional child profile data you've entered</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>fairydust offers a limited-access “Kid Mode” for children under 13, which must be enabled by a parent or guardian.</p>

  <p>Kid Mode does not allow content sharing, personal messaging, or data collection from the child. It limits access to select features such as creative games and storytelling tools. A PIN is required to exit Kid Mode.</p>

  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. Optional child profile information (first name, birthday, photo) can be entered by the adult user and is used only to personalize the Kid Mode experience within that account.</p>

  <p>If we become aware of unintended data collection from a child, we will delete it promptly. Parents or guardians may request review or deletion of any child-related data at any time by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>8. International Users</h2>
  <p>We are based in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the U.S., you agree to the transfer and processing of your data in the U.S. under U.S. laws.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. If changes are significant, we’ll notify you via the app or email.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns, contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@fairydust.ai">privacy@fairydust.ai</a></p>

  <p><strong>By using fairydust, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
